# winapi-typer
WinApi - based typing game with no limits, no rules, except one - you must type the sequence shown on the screen

Visual C++ 2015 is required (Visual Studio 2017 were used to build this thing, despite it does not use anything from .Net or whatever, simple plain winApi)

There are some problems with building from cmd though
